  -Gauge room for who uses kable/gt

-When Dan started developing gtsummary last year it was originally designed for our tables to be printed using knitr::kable(). But mid-last-year Rich Iannone from RStudio started developing a table construction package called {gt}, and even though it’s still in development (and not on CRAN), since it’s from the RStudio world we anticipate it will have full support and eventually be widely adopted, so he switched our package to take full advantage of the functionality {gt} offers. Still can use our package and print with kable, more on that later.
