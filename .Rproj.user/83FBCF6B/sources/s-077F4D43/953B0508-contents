# {gtsummary} reporting with inline_text()
.large[
- Tables are important, but we often need to report results in-line in a report.

- Any statistic reported in a {gtsummary} table can be extracted and reported in-line in an R Markdown document with the `inline_text()` function.

- The pattern of what is reported can be modified with the `pattern = ` argument.  

- Default is `pattern = "{estimate} ({conf.level*100}% CI {conf.low}, {conf.high}; {p.value})"`.
